[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3fwuiks1yq4oro4v/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ohadschn/letsencrypt-webapp-renewer/branch/master)

# !! IMPORTANT NOTE - YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED THIS !!
Microsoft has implemented fully-fledged free managed certificate support (including apex/root/naked domains), so it is highly recommended you use that instead: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#create-a-free-managed-certificate

However, there might be some edge cases where you'd still need the extension, primarily:
* Wildcard certs (DNS challenge)
* Internationalized/punycode domains

If that is the case, read on, but understand: 
## Since I'm not actively using the project myself, I will not actively develop it, and all new releases (if at all), will be betas

# letsencrypt-webapp-renewer
A WebJob-ready console application for renewing Azure Web App TLS/SSL certificates (based on [letsencrypt-siteextension](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension) and [letsencrypt-azure](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-azure)). Officially [recommended by Microsoft](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169385-web-apps/suggestions/6737285-add-support-for-free-ssl-certs-like-those-from-let) for Web App Let's Encrypt integration (prior to native feature availability).

## Motivation
HTTPS is the pervasive standard for all websites, regardless of size or field. 
The Mozilla foundation has gone so far as to [announce their intent to completely phase out HTTP](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/). 
Unfortunately, the procurement, maintenance, and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates has been an expensive and manual process for many. Microsoft have recently added [built-in support for free SSL certificate renewal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#create-a-free-certificate-preview) (in preview), but at the time of writing it is not available for naked (AKA bare/root/apex) domains. So unless you're OK with your clients encountering a certificate error navigating to https://yoursite.com, that won't be good enough for you.

Enter [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority. Shortly after its release, Simon J.K. Pedersen created the excellent [letsencrypt-siteextension](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension) Azure Web App extension for easy integration with Azure Web Apps. However, at the time of writing it suffers from several issues:

- The extension must be installed on the same web app as your site.
  - This means you must install the extension on each and every Web App you own.
  - Worse, if you happen to publish your Web App with the "Delete Existing files", it will silently delete the WebJob created by the extension, effectively nullifying it.
- The extension setup wizard has been known to fall out of sync with the underlying WebJob it's installing (e.g. fail on missing Web App configuraion)
- There are no e-mail notifications (you could set some basic ones with Zapier but they won't contain details on the actual renewals that took place).
- It relies on an Azure Storage account which has to be [configured in a certain way](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/issues/148), which is an unneeded possible point of failure.
- The extension can only be run in the context of a web app. You might want to run it as a command-line tool (e.g. from your CI system).

## Solution
`letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` is a WebJob-ready command-line executable that builds upon [letsencrypt.azure.core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/letsencrypt.azure.core/) (the core component behind letsencrypt-siteextension) to provide the following features:
- Install on any Web App (doesn't have to be the same web app for which you want to manage SSL certs).
  - Multiple Web App management is supported.
  - Publishing with "Delete Existing files" has no effect when the WebJob is deployed to a different (preferably dedicated) Web App.
- Trade off a little convenience (no extension with a setup wizrad) for a higher degree of consistency and reliability
- E-mail notifications are built in (via SendGrid).
- No external dependencies other than Let's Encrypt.
- Can be executed as a plain command-line tool from any environment.

## Walkthrough
Microsoft MVP Dixin Yan wrote an end-to-end guide for using `letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` which you can find [here](https://weblogs.asp.net/dixin/end-to-end-setup-free-ssl-certificate-to-secure-azure-web-app-with-https). Feel free to follow it for your convenience, but it is still recommended to read and understand the full documentation as detailed in the sections below.

## Preparation
Create an AAD service principal with the proper permissions, as explained [here](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/wiki/How-to-install) and [here](https://www.troyhunt.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-loading-a-free-lets-encrypt-certificate-into-an-azure-website/). You can skip the parts about configuring the Azure Storage account and the site extension, but while you're there note down the parameters you'll need for the WebJob configuration below: `SubscriptionId`, `TenantId`, `ResourceGroup`, `WebApp`, `ClientId`, and `ClientSecret`.

## Configuration
The `letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` WebJob is configured via [Web App Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-configure#application-settings). You might as well configure it before installing so that it doesn't run with no/partial configuration by mistake. Note that these settings should be configured on the Web App where the `letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` WebJob is deployed (NOT on the Web Apps to be renewed). You can also use the [configuration script](#using-the-configuration-script) to set/update these values.
1. Set `letsencrypt:webApps` to a semicolon-delimited list of Azure Web App names for which certificate renewal should take place.
1. For each Web App specified in `letsencrypt:webApps`, set the following app setting with the proper values as noted down in the preparation above (replacing `webAppName` with the actual Web App name):
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-subscriptionId`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-tenantId`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-resourceGroup`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-hosts` (semicolon-delimited)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-email` (will be used for both Let's Encrypt registration and e-mail notifications)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-fromEmail` (will be used for both Let's Encrypt registration and e-mail notifications)      
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-clientId`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-clientSecret` (should be set as a **connection string**)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-servicePlanResourceGroup` (optional, defaults to the Web App Resource Group)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-useIpBasedSsl` (optional, defaults to `false`)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-rsaKeyLength` (optional, defaults to `2048`)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-acmeBaseUri` (optional, defaults to `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-webRootPath` (optional, defaults to `%HOME%\site\wwwroot` or in case of running from package: `%HOME%\site\letsencrypt`)
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-renewXNumberOfDaysBeforeExpiration` (optional, defaults to `-1` which means renewal will take place regardless of the expiry time)

For more information about the various renewal settings see: https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension.

### Sample configuration
- `letsencrypt:webApps`: `ohadsoft;howlongtobeatsteam`
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-subscriptionId`: `e432f869-4777-4380-a654-3440216992a2`
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-tenantId`: `ohadsoft.onmicrosoft.com`
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-resourceGroup`: `ohadsoft-rg`
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-hosts`: `www.ohadsoft.com;ohadsoft.com;my√ºmlautdomain.de` (note the Internationalized Domain Name [IDN] support)
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-email`: `renewal@ohadsoft.com`
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-fromEmail`: `donotreply@ohadsoft.com`
- `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-clientId`: `5e1346b6-7db5-4eae-b9fa-7b3d5e42e6c7`
- (**connection string**) `letsencrypt:ohadsoft-clientSecret`: `MySecretPassword123`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-subscriptionId`: `e432f869-4777-4380-a654-3440216992a2`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-tenantId`: `ohadsoft.onmicrosoft.com`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-resourceGroup`: `hltbs-rg`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-hosts`: `www.howlongtobeatsteam.com;howlongtobeatsteam.com`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-email`: `renewal@howlongtobeatsteam.com`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-fromEmail`: `donotreply@howlongtobeatsteam.com`
- `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-clientId`: `5e1346b6-7db5-4eae-b9fa-7b3d5e42e6c7`
- (**connection string**) `letsencrypt:howlongtobeatsteam-clientSecret`: `MySecretPassword123`

### Sovereign Cloud (Mooncake, BlackForest, etc.)
The following settings are required in order to renew certificates on sovereign clouds:
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureAuthenticationEndpoint`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureTokenAudience`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureManagementEndpoint`
   1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDefaultWebSiteDomainName`

You can run the `Get-AzureEnvironment` PowerShell cmdlet to get the required values. For more information about configuring sovereign clouds see: https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/wiki/Azure-Germany,-US-or-China.

### DNS Challenge

You may use the ACME DNS challenge instead of the HTTP challenge. Currently only Azure or GoDaddy DNS is supported.

Azure DNS can be activated using the following configuration:
1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsZoneName` (e.g. `yourDomain.com`, note that for Internationalized Domain Names [IDNs] you must use the punycode name e.g `xn--mymlautdomain-xob.de`)
2. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsRelativeRecordSetName` (e.g. `yourSubDomain`)
3. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsTenantId` (optional, defaults to Web App Tenant ID)
4. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsSubscriptionId` (optional, defaults to Web App Subscription ID)
5. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsResourceGroup` (optional, defaults to Web App Resource Group)
6. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsClientId` (optional, defaults to Web App Client ID)
7. `letsencrypt:webAppName-azureDnsClientSecret` (optional, defaults to Web App Client Secret)

GoDaddy DNS can be activated using the following configuration:
1. `letsencrypt:webAppName-goDaddyDnsApiKey`
2. `letsencrypt:webAppName-goDaddyDnsApiSecret`
3. `letsencrypt:webAppName-goDaddyDnsDomain` (e.g. `yourDomain.com`)
4. `letsencrypt:webAppName-goDaddyDnsShopperId`

#### DNS Challenge Limitations
* Only wildcard host names are supported (must begin with `*.`)
* App Service Plan and App Service must reside in the same resource group (Azure DNS)
* `renewXNumberOfDaysBeforeExpiration` is not supported

### Site Deployment Slots
In order to specify a Site Deployment Slot for a given web app, use the following syntax for the web app's name: `webAppName{siteSlotName}`. For example, if you have a `foo` site with no deployment slots and a `bar` site with `staging` and `prod` deployment slots, configure `letsencrypt:webApps` to be `foo;bar{staging};bar{prod}`. Different deployment slots are treated as different web apps and the normal setting rules apply, so you would still need to configure the regular settings for each of them (e.g. `letsencrypt:foo-subscriptionId`, `letsencrypt:bar{staging}-subscriptionId`, `letsencrypt:bar{prod}-subscriptionId` and so forth). 

### Shared configuration
It is sometimes useful to share configuraiton settings beween web apps. For example, you might be using the same client credentials, the same subscription ID, or the same resource group for multiple web apps. In order to share a configuration setting between web apps, simply omit the `webAppName-` component of the configuration key. For example, in order to configure shared client credentials, set the `letsencrypt:clientId` app setting and `letsencrypt:clientSecret` connection string. These values will now be used by default for all configured web apps, unless explicitly overriden by setting the fully WebApp-qualified key name (by including the `webAppName-` component, e.g. `letsencrypt:mySpecialSite-clientId`).

All settings except `hosts`may be shared.

### Multiple certificates for a single site
If you have a site that supports many domain names, it can be useful to group them into separate certificates. In order to handle renewing multiple certificates associated with a single site, use the following syntax for the web app's name: `webAppName[groupName]` or `webAppName{siteSlotName}[groupName]`. For example, if you have a `foo` site that has two certificates that need to be updated, configure `letsencrypt:webApps` to be `foo;foo[Group2]`. You would still need to configure the regular settings for each of them (e.g. `letsencrypt:foo-subscriptionId`, `letsencrypt:foo[Group2]-subscriptionId` and so forth).

### Using the configuration script
There is a PowerShell configuration-script [Set-LetsEncryptConfiguration.ps1](src/Scripts/Set-LetsEncryptConfiguration.ps1) which can be used to streamline the configuration of multiple Web Apps. Running the script is straightfoward, and further documentation resides inside it.

## Installation
1. (**optional but highly recommended**) Create a new dedicated Web App for cert renewal, to which you will deploy the `letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` WebJob. This will drastically decrease the likelihood of accidental deletion of the renewal WebJob  (e.g. upon deployment of a different app to the same Web App using _Delete Existing files_)
1. Download the latest [`letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` WebJob zip file](https://github.com/ohadschn/letsencrypt-webapp-renewer/releases).
1. Deploy the WebJob zip file you downloaded above to the Web App where you want cert renewal to execute using one of the following scheduling methods:
   1. [CRON based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs#CreateScheduledCRON) is simple to set up but **REQUIRES YOUR CERT RENEWAL WEB APP (THE ONE WHERE THE `letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` WEBJOB WILL BE RUNNING) TO BE CONFIGURED AS "ALWAYS ON"**. Note that a `settings.job` file as described in the docs is unnecessary - when you [upload the WebJob in the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs#CreateOnDemand) simply select **Triggered** in the _Type_ field and **Scheduled** in the _Triggers_ field to be given an option to specify a CRON expression. The [recommended Let's Encrypt renewal period is 60 days](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/), so you could use a CRON expression that fires once every two months, for example: `0 0 0 1 1,3,5,7,9,11 *`.
   1. [Azure Function based](https://github.com/eformedpartners/AzureWebJobScheduler/) is a good option if your App Service plan does not support _Always On_ (_Free_ or _Shared_).
   1. [Azure Logic App based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/scheduler/migrate-from-scheduler-to-logic-apps) is another good option that does not require _Always On_
      1. Logic Apps can be configured to run periodically (e.g every 60 days)
      2. Allows easy configuration of notifications (send O365 email, Twilio SMS, etc), as an alternative (or in addition) to SendGrid
      3. Requires one-time [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/concepts-schedule-automated-recurring-tasks-workflows) of user/password authentication to initiate the WebJob.

### ASP.NET Core
1. Enable `ServeUnknownFileTypes` for the `/.well-known/acme-challenge` request path of your Web App.
1. When targeting a Linux based ASP.NET Core Web App, set the `webRootPath` to the following (relative) path: `./site/wwwroot/wwwroot`.

### Notifications
The following are optional but **highly recommended**.
1. Set up [SendGrid](https://app.sendgrid.com/) email notifications to notify you of successful renewals:
   1. Set the `letsencrypt:SendGridApiKey` connection string to your [SendGrid API key](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/How_Emails_Are_Sent/api_keys.html). At the time of writing, SendGrid offer a free plan in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/SendGrid.SendGrid) which should easily suffice for this use case.
   1. Configure [Single Sender Verification](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) for the email address that SendGrid should send email as.
1. Set up [Zapier](https://zapier.com/help/windows-azure-web-sites/) to send you notifications on `letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` WebJob runs. While e-mail notifications are supported as described above, **they will not be fired when the WebJob has failed for any reason** (this is intentional - a WebJob cannot reliably handle any possible failure it might encounter). By contrast, Zapier operates externally to the WebJob and should be able to report any error that might have caused the WebJob to fail. At the time of writing, Zapier offer a free account which should easily suffice for any reasonable SSL renewal notification needs.
1. If you created a Logic App to schedule the Web Job, set up notifications using any number of connectors 
   1. [Gmail](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/gmail/)
   1. [Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365/)
   1. [Twilio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-twilio) 
   1. Or choose [another](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors) connector

Note that Let's Encrypt will send out expiration e-mails if anything went wrong with the cert renewal process: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/. However, Let's Encrypt are not aware of Azure Web Apps, so if the cert was renewed successfully but some failure prevented it from actually being installed to your Web App, they would not know and hence no expiration e-mail would be sent from their system. This highlights the importance of the Zapier configuration above.

## Verification
Test the WebJob by [triggering it manually](https://pragmaticdevs.wordpress.com/2016/10/24/triggering-azure-web-jobs-manually/). **You should see a new certificate served when you visit your site**.

## Command Line usage
When executed outside of a WebJob context (as determined by the absence of the [WEBJOBS_NAME](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/WebJobs#environment-settings) environment variable), the WebJob executable (`AzureLetsEncryptRenewer.exe`) functions as a standalone command-line tool with the following options:

## Telemetry
`letsencrypt-webapp-renewer` gathers anonymous telemetry for usage analysis and error reporting. You can disable it by setting the `LETSENCRYPT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to any non-empty value.

## Limitations & Disclaimer 
Since this project relies on https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension, some of its limitations apply as well:
> This site-extension is NOT supported by Microsoft it is my own work based on https://github.com/ebekker/ACMESharp and https://github.com/Lone-Coder/letsencrypt-win-simple - this means don't expect 24x7 support, I use it for several of my own smaller sites, but if you are running sites that are important you should consider spending the few $ on a certificate and go with a Microsoft supported way of enabling SSL, so you have someone to blame :)

> Note that Let's Encrypt works by providing automated certificates of a short (currently three month) duration. This extension is BETA SOFTWARE. You will need to keep this extension updated or risk losing SSL access when your certificate expires.

> Due to rate limiting of Let's Encrypt servers, you can only request five certificates per domain name per week. Configuration errors or errors in this site extension may render you unable to retrieve a new certificate for seven days. If up-time is critical, have a plan for deploying a SSL certificate from another source in place.

> No support for multi-region web apps, so if you use traffic manager or some other load balancer to route traffic between web apps in different regions please don't use this extension.

> The site-extension will not work with Azure App Service Local Cache

> Please take note that this Site-Extension is beta-software, so use at your own risk.
